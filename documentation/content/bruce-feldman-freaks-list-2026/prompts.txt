The following players were not matched in the database. They are part of Bruce Feldman's freaks list for 2026.
Therefore I want to seed them in the database and then match them for the freaks badging.
They should be added to our database seeding data file.
For each player below go out and find their measurables, their height, their weight, that sort of thing.
- Kendrick Law (WR, Kentucky)
- Mike Washington (RB, Arkansas)
- Jaren Kanak (TE, Oklahoma)
- John Michael Gyllenborg (TE, Wyoming)
- Chris Hilton Jr. (WR, LSU)
- Darrell Jackson (DT, Florida State)
- Grayson Halton (DL, Oklahoma)
- David Gusta (DL, Kentucky)
